    <h3>Objects are hash tables, they store information in a key-value pair.<br>They are very similar to dictionaries in Python.<br>
    Unlike an array, a Javascript Object does NOT retain order, instead you accessthe value you want by entering its corresponding key. <br>They can hold a variety of data types, including nested Objects.</h3>


    <h3>Besides key-value pairs for normal data types, you can add in methods! <br>Methods are essentially functions that are built into a javascript object.
      <br>Usually we've called a function and then passed stuff as parameters, <br>now we
    will build this function inside of an object, creating a method for that object.</h3>
